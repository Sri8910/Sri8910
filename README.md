- âš¡ Fun fact:

Passionate about Programming, Machine learning, and Web Development.

I used to think about how one can create a stunning application, a web, a social media platform. As I grew, I found that all these wonders are happening because of Programming. It caused me to develop my passion for programming.

My interest in Machine Learning started with the boom of Data science. By exploring, I began with  Andrew Ng's course and learned about various algorithms used in Machine Learning.

I am looking forward to improving my problem-solving skills and also work consistently to achieve better performance with constant learning and to upskill myself.
